Maps Compose ðŸ—º
===============

## Description
This repository contains [Jetpack Compose][jetpack-compose] components for the Maps SDK for Android.

## Requirements
* Kotlin-enabled project
* Jetpack Compose-enabled project (see [releases](https://github.com/googlemaps/android-maps-compose/releases) for the required version of Jetpack Compose)
* An [API key][api-key]
* API level 21+

## Usage

Adding a map to your app looks like the following:

```kotlin
val singapore = LatLng(1.35, 103.87)
val cameraPositionState = rememberCameraPositionState {
    position = CameraPosition.fromLatLngZoom(singapore, 10f)
}
GoogleMap(
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
    cameraPositionState = cameraPositionState
)
```

### Creating and configuring a map

Configuring the map can be done by passing a `MapProperties` object into the 
`GoogleMap` composable, or for UI-related configurations, use `MapUiSettings`.
`MapProperties` and `MapUiSettings` should be your first go-to for configuring
the map. For any other configuration not present in those two classes, use
`googleMapOptionsFactory` to provide a `GoogleMapOptions` instance instead. 
Typically, anything that can only be provided once (i.e. when the map is 
created)â€”like map IDâ€”should be provided via `googleMapOptionsFactory`.

```kotlin
// Set properties using MapProperties which you can use to recompose the map
var mapProperties by remember {
    mutableStateOf(
        MapProperties(maxZoomPreference = 10f, minZoomPreference = 5f)
    )
}
var mapUiSettings by remember {
    mutableStateOf(
        MapUiSettings(mapToolbarEnabled = false)
    )
}
Box(Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
    GoogleMap(properties = mapProperties, uiSettings = mapUiSettings)
    Column {
        Button(onClick = {
            mapProperties = mapProperties.copy(
                isBuildingEnabled = !mapProperties.isBuildingEnabled
            )
        }) {
            Text(text = "Toggle isBuildingEnabled")
        }
        Button(onClick = {
            mapUiSettings = mapUiSettings.copy(
                mapToolbarEnabled = !mapUiSettings.mapToolbarEnabled
            )
        }) {
            Text(text = "Toggle mapToolbarEnabled")
        }
    }
}

// ...or initialize the map by providing a googleMapOptionsFactory
// This should only be used for values that do not recompose the map such as
// map ID.
GoogleMap(
    googleMapOptionsFactory = {
        GoogleMapOptions().mapId("MyMapId")
    }
)

```

### Controlling a map's camera

Camera changes and updates can be observed and controlled via `CameraPositionState`.

**Note**: `CameraPositionState` is the source of truth for anything camera 
related. So, providing a camera position in `GoogleMapOptions` will be 
overridden by `CameraPosition`.

```kotlin
val singapore = LatLng(1.35, 103.87)
val cameraPositionState: CameraPositionState = rememberCameraPositionState {
    position = CameraPosition.fromLatLngZoom(singapore, 11f)
}
Box(Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
  GoogleMap(cameraPositionState = cameraPositionState)
  Button(onClick = {
    // Move the camera to a new zoom level
    cameraPositionState.move(CameraUpdateFactory.zoomIn())
  }) {
      Text(text = "Zoom In")
  }
}
```

### Drawing on a map

Drawing on the map, such as adding markers, can be accomplished by adding child 
composable elements to the content of the `GoogleMap`.

```kotlin
GoogleMap(
  //...
) {
    Marker(
        state = MarkerState(position = LatLng(-34, 151)),
        title = "Marker in Sydney"
    )
    Marker(
        state = MarkerState(position = LatLng(35.66, 139.6)),
        title = "Marker in Tokyo"
    )
}
```

#### Customizing a marker's info window

You can customize a marker's info window contents by using the 
`MarkerInfoWindowContent` element, or if you want to customize the entire info 
window, use the `MarkerInfoWindow` element instead. Both of these elements
accept a `content` parameter to provide your customization in a composable
lambda expression.

```kotlin
MarkerInfoWindowContent(
    //...
) { marker ->
    Text(marker.title ?: "Default Marker Title", color = Color.Red)
}

MarkerInfoWindow(
    //...
) { marker ->
    // Implement the custom info window here
    Column {
        Text(marker.title ?: "Default Marker Title", color = Color.Red)
        Text(marker.snippet ?: "Default Marker Snippet", color = Color.Red)
    }
}
```

#### Obtaining Access to the raw GoogleMap (Experimental)

Certain use cases require extending the `GoogleMap` object to decorate / augment
the map. For example, while marker clustering is not yet supported by Maps Compose
(see [Issue #44](https://github.com/googlemaps/android-maps-compose/issues/44)),
it is desirable to use the available [utility library](https://github.com/googlemaps/android-maps-utils)
to perform clustering in the interim. Doing so requires access to the Maps SDK
`GoogleMap` object which you can obtain with the `MapEffect` composable.

```kotlin
GoogleMap(
    // ...
) {
    val context = LocalContext.current
    var clusterManager by remember { mutableStateOf<ClusterManager<MyItem>?>(null) }
    MapEffect(items) { map ->
        if (clusterManager == null) {
            clusterManager = ClusterManager<MyItem>(context, map)
        }
        clusterManager?.addItems(items)
    }
    
    MarkerInfoWindow(
        state = rememberMarkerState(position = LatLng(1.35, 103.87)),
        onClick = {
            // This won't work :(
            Log.d("MapEffect", "I cannot be clicked :( $it")
            true
        }
    )

}
```

Note, however, that `MapEffect` is designed as an escape hatch and has certain
gotchas. The `GoogleMap` composable provided by the Maps Compose library manages
properties while the `GoogleMap` is in composition, and so, setting properties
on the `GoogleMap` instance provided in the `MapEffect` composable may have
unintended consequences. For instance, using the utility library to perform 
clustering as shown in the example above will break `onClick` events from
being propagated on `Marker` composables as shown in the comment above. So, if 
you are using clustering, stick with adding markers through the `ClusterManager`
and don't use `Marker` composables (unless you don't care about `onClick` 
events). Clustering is the only use-case tested with `MapEffect`, there may be
gotchas depending on what features you use in the utility library.

## Widgets

This library also provides optional composable widgets in the `maps-compose-widgets` library that you can use alongside the `GoogleMap` composable.

### ScaleBar

This widget shows the current scale of the map in feet and meters when zoomed into the map, changing to miles and kilometers, respectively, when zooming out. A `DisappearingScaleBar` is also included, which appears when the zoom level of the map changes, and then disappears after a configurable timeout period.

The [ScaleBarActivity](app/src/main/java/com/google/maps/android/compose/ScaleBarActivity.kt) demonstrates both of these, with the `DisappearingScaleBar` in the upper left corner and the normal base `ScaleBar` in the upper right:

![maps-compose-scale-bar-cropped](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/928045/175665891-a0635004-2201-4392-83b3-0c6553b96926.gif)

Both versions of this widget leverage the `CameraPositionState` in `maps-compose` and therefore are very simple to configure with their defaults:

```kotlin
ScaleBar(
    modifier = Modifier
            .padding(top = 5.dp, end = 15.dp)
            .align(Alignment.TopEnd),
    cameraPositionState = cameraPositionState
)

DisappearingScaleBar(
    modifier = Modifier
            .padding(top = 5.dp, end = 15.dp)
            .align(Alignment.TopStart),
    cameraPositionState = cameraPositionState
)
```

The colors of the text, line, and shadow are also all configurable (e.g., based on `isSystemInDarkTheme()` on a dark map). Similarly, the `DisappearingScaleBar` animations can be configured.

## Sample App

This repository includes a [sample app](app).

To run it, you'll have to:
1. Get a [Maps API key][api-key]
1. Add an entry in `local.properties` that looks like `MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY`
1. Build and run
